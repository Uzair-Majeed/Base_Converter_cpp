## Description
This program converts a given **positive floating-point number** into a specified base (from base 2 to base 16).

## Features
- Converts a floating-point number into any base between **2 and 16**.
- Uses a **dynamic character array** to store and return the converted result.

## How It Works
The program asks the user to input:
   - A positive floating-point number to convert.
   - The desired base for the conversion.
The  result is displayed as a concatenation of the integer and decimal representations.
